    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content">web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a> or from local storage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine">render</a> them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">webpage</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects">images</a> and other objects such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset">interactive forms</a> may be embedded. HTML provides a way to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a> using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and quotes. Tags such as &lt;<strong style="color:green">img</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green">input</strong>&gt; insert content directly, while others like &lt;<strong style="color:green">p</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green">/p</strong>&gt; provide structure. Browsers don’t display the tags, but use them to interpret the content.</p>

    <p>HTML can embed scripts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> that affect page behavior. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, which maintains HTML standards, has encouraged using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> for layout since 1997. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> supports video and audio via the &lt;<strong style="color:green">canvas</strong>&gt; element with JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <b>Development</b>

    <p>In 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist">physicist</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, while at
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>
, a system to share documents. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system. He defined HTML and built the first browser and server software in 1990.

    That year, Berners-Lee and CERN<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system">Data system
</a> engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.<sup>[5]</sup>
</p>

    <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN_SGML">CERN SGML</a>., an in-house  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Markup Language </a>(SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]

    <p>HTML is a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a>use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or
       audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics 
       can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. 
       Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988
        ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used 
        by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a>
         developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system.
         These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However,
          the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print 
          effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

    <p>HTML was formalized as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a> application of SGML in 1993, with proposals from Berners-Lee and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing draft added features like tables and forms.</p>

    <p>After early drafts expired, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, HTML 2.0 became the first formal standard. Further development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a> in 1996. HTML became an international standard in 2000. HTML5 was developed from 2004, completed in 2014.</p>

    <h3>HTML Version Timeline</h3>

    <h4>HTML 2</h4>
    <p><strong>November 24, 1995</strong></p>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was published as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1866" target="_blank">RFC 1866</a>. Supplemental RFCs added:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nov 25, 1995: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1867" target="_blank">RFC 1867</a> (file upload)</li>
      <li>May 1996: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1942" target="_blank">RFC 1942</a> (tables)</li>
      <li>Aug 1996: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1980" target="_blank">RFC 1980</a> (image maps)</li>
      <li>Jan 1997: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2070" target="_blank">RFC 2070</a> (<em>internationalization</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTML 3</h3>
<p><strong>January 14, 1997</strong></p>
<p>
  HTML 3.2<sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32" target="_blank">[16]</a></sup> was published as a 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32" target="_blank">W3C Recommendation</a>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>, as the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" target="_blank">IETF</a> had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.
  <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/" target="_blank">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  Initially code-named "Wilbur",
  <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions, and adopted most of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communications" target="_blank">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags. Netscape's 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_element" target="_blank">blink element</a> and 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquee_element" target="_blank">Microsoft's marquee element</a> were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
  <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32/" target="_blank">[14]</a></sup>
  A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/" target="_blank">MathML</a>.

  <h2>HTML 4</h2>

  <p><span class="date">December 18, 1997</span><br>
    HTML 4.0<sup>[19]</sup> was published as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">W3C Recommendation</a>. It offers three variations:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strict</strong>, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
      <li><strong>Transitional</strong>, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
      <li><strong>Frameset</strong>, in which mostly only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_frames">frame</a> related elements are allowed</li>
    </ul>
    Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[18]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific elements from Netscape and Internet Explorer, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html">marking them as deprecated</a> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<sup>[20]</sup>
  </p>

  <p><span class="date">April 24, 1998</span><br>
    HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
  </p>

  <p><span class="date">December 24, 1999</span><br>
    HTML 4.01<sup>[22]</sup> was published again with three variations. The same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata<sup>[23]</sup> was published on May 12, 2001.
  </p>

  <p><span class="date">May 2000</span><br>
    ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[24]</sup> ("<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/26369.html">ISO HTML</a>", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.<sup>[25]</sup> It is documented in the domain of the <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45354.html">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34</a> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).<sup>[26]</sup>
  </p>

  <p><em>After HTML 4, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language <strong>XHTML</strong> occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.</em></p>

  <h3>April 1995 (authored March 1995)</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="#">HTML 3.0</a><sup>[44]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)<sup>[45]</sup> without further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures, and the display of complex mathematical formulas.<sup>[45]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    W3C began development of its own <a href="#">Arena browser</a> as a <a href="#">test bed</a> for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,<sup>[46][47][48]</sup> but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.<sup>[14]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.<sup>[14]</sup> (See <a href="#">browser wars</a>.) These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."<sup>[14]</sup> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."<sup>[14]</sup>
  </p>

  <h3>January 2008</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="#">HTML5</a> was published as a <a href="#">Working Draft</a> by the W3C.<sup>[49]</sup>
    Although its syntax closely resembles that of <a href="#">SGML</a>, <a href="#">HTML5</a> has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.<sup>[50]</sup>
  </p>

  <h3>2011 HTML5 – Last Call</h3>
  <p>
    On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<sup>[51]</sup>
  </p>

  <p><small>Logo of HTML5</small></p>
    <h3>2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</h3>
  <p>
    In July 2012, WHATWG and <a href="#">W3C</a> decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[53]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[54]</sup> The criterion for advancement to <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a> is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<sup>[55]</sup>
  </p>

  <h3>2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</h3>
  <p>
    In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup>[56]</sup>
    On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<sup>[57]</sup> meaning the specification process is complete.<sup>[58]</sup>
  </p>

  <h3>XHTML versions</h3>
  <p><em>Main article:</em> <a href="#">XHTML</a></p>
  <p>
    XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="#">XML</a> 1.0. It is now referred to as <em>the XML syntax for HTML</em> and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.<sup>[59]</sup>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,<sup>[60]</sup> and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
    <li>XHTML 1.1<sup>[61]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.<sup>[62]</sup></li>
    <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft. Work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on <a href="#">HTML5</a> and <a href="#">XHTML5</a>.<sup>[63][64][65]</sup> XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Transition of HTML publication to WHATWG</h3>
  <p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#">HTML5 &sect; W3C and WHATWG conflict</a></p>
  <p>
    On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.<sup>[66][67][68][69]</sup>
    The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.<sup>[70]</sup>
    The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the <em>de facto</em> web standard for some time.<sup>[71]</sup>
  </p>

  <h3>Markup</h3>
  <p>
    HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called <em>tags</em> (and their <em>attributes</em>), character-based <em>data types</em>, <em>character references</em> and <em>entity references</em>. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent <em>empty elements</em> and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.
    The first tag in such a pair is the <em>start tag</em>, and the second is the <em>end tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important component is the HTML <a href="#">document type declaration</a>, which triggers <a href="#">standards mode</a> rendering.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is an example of the classic <a href="#">"Hello, World!" program</a>:
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
 <h3>Elements</h3>
  <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested <a href="#">HTML elements</a>. These are indicated in the document by HTML <em>tags</em>, enclosed in angle brackets.</p>
  <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and "end tag" <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
  <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
  <p>The start tag may also include the element's <em>attributes</em> within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: <br>
  <code>&lt;img src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;</code></p>
  <p>Some elements, such as the <a href="#">line break</a> <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> do not permit <em>any</em> embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
  <img src="file-3CptbffW8Ry7SAKYNXi7N1">
    <h3>Element Examples</h3>
  <p><em>See also:</em> <a href="#">HTML element</a></p>
  <p>Header of the HTML document: <code>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</code>. The title is included in the head, for example:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;The Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="stylebyjimbowales.css"&gt; &lt;!-- Imports Stylesheets --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

  <h3>Headings</h3>
  <p>HTML headings are defined with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;
</code></pre>

  <p>The effects are:</p>
  <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
  <hr>

    code {
      background-color: #f6f8fa;
      color: green;
      font-family: monospace;
      padding: 2px 4px;
      border-radius: 4px;
    }
    pre {
      background-color: #f6f8fa;

<h3>Paragraphs:</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code>. The difference between <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is that <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> sections the page into paragraphs. The element <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is an <i>empty element</i> in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it must not have an end tag.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;br&gt; is a paragraph &lt;br&gt; with &lt;br&gt; line breaks&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>This is a link in HTML. To create a link the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is used. The <code>href</code> attribute holds the URL address of the link.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;A link to Wikipedia!&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>There are many possible ways a user can give inputs like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type="text"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for text input --&gt;
&lt;input type="file"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for uploading files --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for checkboxes --&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Headings</h3>
<p>HTML offers six levels of headings:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Heading 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Ordered and unordered lists in HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Banana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Creating tables with rows and cells:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Alice&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre
